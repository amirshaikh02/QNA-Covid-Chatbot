        <h1>QNA Covid Chatbot </h1>
        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The spread of COVID-19 across the world, there is a sense 	of panic and uncertainty amongst the public.
            People are not sure what measures to take to safeguard themselves and their <br> 
            family and have many questions. Moreover, rumors, myths and misinformation about COVID-19 have spread as quickly as the virus itself. 
            Public health hotlines and patient communication<br>systems are now dealing with many more inquiries than normal, putting a strain on existing resources. 
            There is a need for health organizations to automate as many responses to these inquiries <br> as possible to free up human resources to deal with more complex problems in the fight against this pandemic.
